Now I really got used to Canon and can’t imagine to switch to another brand anymore. Probably also because I’m not really into all the technical stuff and I’m unable to cope when things don’t work the way I’m used to.

The cost of someone not getting the money is however most certainly bigger than just the missed interests; the potential borrower might very well go away and never come back, without us ever
